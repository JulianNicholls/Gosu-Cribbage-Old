Cribbage using Gosu
===================

This will be a game of cribbage running under the Ruby
[Gosu](http:http://www.libgosu.org/) gem.

So far, two hands are dealt, and discards can be selected from the player's hand
via the mouse. After discarding, clicking on the pack at the right hand side will
cut a card, and display the value of the player's hand with the cut card. This can
be done repeatedly for now.

Press Escape to Exit.
