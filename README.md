Cribbage in Gosu
================

This will be a game of cribbage running under the Ruby 
[Gosu](http:http://www.libgosu.org/) gem.

So far, two hands are dealt, and discards can be selected from the player's hand
via the mouse. Clicking on the pack at the right hand side will cut a card, and 
display the value of the player's hand with the cut card. This can be done 
repeatedly.
