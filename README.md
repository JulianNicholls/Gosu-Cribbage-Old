# Cribbage using Gosu

This will eventually be a game of cribbage running under the Ruby
[Gosu](http:http://www.libgosu.org/) gem.

Two hands are dealt, and discards can be selected from the player's hand
via the mouse. For now, the computer just discards a random pair of cards.

After discarding, clicking on the pack at the right hand side will
cut a card, and display the value of the player's hand with the cut card.

After the card is cut, it is up to the player to start the play to 31. The CPU
will also choose cards in turn. 15s, 31s,  and goes are scored.

Once the play to 31 is complete, that's shallot for now :-)
